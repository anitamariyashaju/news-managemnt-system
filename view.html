                Fifteen-year-old Braden Wilson was frightened of COVID-19. He was careful to wear masks and only left his house, in Simi Valley, California, for things like orthodontist checkups and visits with his grandparents nearby.
                
                But somehow, the virus found Braden. It wreaked ruthless damage in the form of an inflammatory syndrome that, for unknown reasons, strikes some young people, usually several weeks after infection by the coronavirus.</td>

              <td>“There is the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batsman… I have a weakness for that kind of player! What an irresistible player Rishabh Pant is,” Adam Gilchrist wrote in a column last month. Pant has a long way to go to match his idol, but if his development continues on the right track, an adequate replacement for MS Dhoni is a not-so-distant possibility. Indian fans, too, are warming up to the youngster’s cricket. Not many moons ago, crowds in Indian grounds used to chant Dhoni’s name whenever Pant made a mistake. During the second Test in Chennai, Dhoni’s spiritual home, fans sang Pant’s name in appreciation.</td>
